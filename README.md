A library for rendering the classic **DOOM "melt" screen transition effect** on OLED displays using the SSD1306 driver and the U8g2 graphics library.

## ðŸŽ¬ Inspired By

This library was inspired by the iconic DOOM melt screen transition seen in classic games.  
The idea came from this video demonstration:  
ðŸ”— [DOOM transition explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUsCXSNhHmI)

After watching it, I decided to implement this effect for microcontrollers with SSD1306 displays.

## âœ¨ Features

- Smooth DOOM-style "melt" animation from one image to another
- Optimized for SSD1306 128x64 displays
- Built on top of the U8g2 library
- Supports per-column delay to simulate realistic "melting"

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- [U8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2) graphics library
- An SSD1306-compatible OLED display (tested on 128x64)
- Arduino-compatible microcontroller

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Copy the library folder into your Arduino `libraries/` directory
2. Include it in your sketch:

```cpp
#include <SSD1306-Doom_melt.h>
